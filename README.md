# Integrative network analysis of transcriptomics data reveals potential prognostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer

**Highlights:**

• To study rewired pathway cross-talk guided by state-dependent gene co-expression \
• State-dependent pathway cross-talk networks were analysed along with domain knowledge \
• PTPRC mediate pathway crosstalk among immune system and with other signaling pathways \
• Cell communication and vascular smooth muscle cross-talk involved in CRC progression \
• Rewired ITGA7 interactions impact the EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) in CRC \

**Datasets:** 

• Gene Expression: Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) \
• Pathways genesets: MSigDB (Molecular Signature Database, https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb) \ 

**Code**

In the GitHub repository, there are two main directories: \
**Python:** Pathway cross-talk network construction
**R:**  Gene expression analysis and gene regulatory analysis
