# Pathway Cross-talk Analysis 
Integration of gene expression data with pathway information 




# Type I Pathway cross-talk.py
This Python script is designed to identify Type I pathway cross-talk by analyzing co-expressed genes belonging to different pathways. 

# Type II Pathway cross-talk.py
This Python script is designed to identify Type II pathway cross-talk by analyzing co-expressed genes belonging to different pathways. 

# Gene Expression Analysis 
This R script performs the normalization of raw microarray data, identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the limma package, calculates the Pearson correlation between genes, and extracts significant correlations based on predefined criteria. Additionally, it also compares the correlation patterns across different datasets.
