# Pathway cross-talk-analysis (Integration of gene expression data with pathway information)

Gene regulatory network analysis

Ensure all files are correctly named and located in the script's directory.
# Type I Pathway cross-talk.py

# Type II Pathway cross-talk.py
To facilitate the analysis of Type II pathway cross-talk, this Python script reads gene sets from two CSV files, "Pathway genesets" and "Gene Co-expression". It then identifies shared genes between pairs of genes and extracts unique pathways for each gene pair.
